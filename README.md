# scubaclub

A simple site to organize scuba clubs. Purpose is to easily allow scuba clubs to arange dives, organize the filling of equipment and other dive club related activities. All existing solutions are rather commercial and pricely for most scuba clubs that run on volunteers. Or simply don't exist.

Main focus for now is create something to facility my own club where I'm boardmember.

- Enable users to create dive clubs
- Enable users to orchestrate dive trainings and show their trainings
- Enable users to suggest and edit dive locations
- Enable users to organize dives and join them

## Tech setup

Django as main framework. PostgreSQL as the backend database.

## Colours

Focus for now is to have a minimal site with a purple accent.
